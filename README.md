Django-allauth is a Django package that provides a set of views, templates, and helper functions to handle user authentication, registration, and account management.

It is built on top of Djangoâ€™s authentication framework and provides additional functionality to make it easier to integrate with third-party authentication providers, such as social media platforms.
